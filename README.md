# Kicktipp-Bot

This script can automatically enter tips into Kicktipp based on the quotes of the bookmakers. It is written in Python and uses Selenium to interact with the website.

## Easy Install

Execute the commands below in the `Terminal`-Program:

```bash
# Install brew if not already
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Docker if not already
brew install docker

# Get Image
docker pull antonengelhardt/kicktipp-bot

# Run Container and set your env variables
docker run \
-it \
--name kicktipp-bot \
-e KICKTIPP_EMAIL=<YOUR_EMAIL> \
-e KICKTIPP_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASSWORD> \
-e KICKTIPP_NAME_OF_COMPETITION=<NAME_OF_COMPETITION> \
-e ZAPIER_URL<URL> \
antonengelhardt/kicktipp-bot
```

## Zapier Integration

If you want to receive a notification when the script tips for a match, you can use the Zapier integration. Please create a Zapier Account and set up the following Trigger: Custom Webhook. Please also make sure you set the ENV Variable `ZAPIER_URL` to the URL of your custom webhook. Then you can set up actions like sending an email or a push notification.

## Make commands

This project uses `make` to simplify the execution of commands. The following commands are available:

- `make all` - run `docker-build` and `docker-push`
- `make local-run` - Runs the script locally with GUI and without Zapier
- `make local-run-with-zapier` - Runs the script locally with GUI and with Zapier
- `make docker-build` - Builds the Docker image
- `make docker-run` - Runs the Docker image
- `make docker-build-and-push` - Builds and pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub
- `make docker-reset` - Stops and removes the Docker container
- `make docker-all` - Runs all Docker commands

## Setup when running without Docker

1. Clone the repository

2. Install chromedriver (<https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads>)

    Please choose the version that corresponds to your Chrome version.

3. Install the requirements

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set the constant `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH` to the path of the chromedriver executable.

    It is recommended to place the executable in the same directory as the script or into the Applications folder.

5. Set the constants `EMAIL`, `PASSWORD`, `NAME_OF_COMPETITON` and `ZAPIER_URL` as environment variables to your Kicktipp credentials to the day on which the script should be executed. 

    For zsh:

    ```bash
    echo 'export KICKTIPP_EMAIL=<KICKTIPP_EMAIL>' >> ~/.zshenv  
    echo 'export KICKTIPP_PASSWORD=<KICKTIPP_PASSWORD>' >> ~/.zshenv   
    echo 'export KICKTIPP_NAME_OF_COMPETITION=<NAME_OF_COMPETITION>' >> ~/.zshenv
    # ZAPIER_URL is optional
    echo 'export ZAPIER_URL=<ZAPIER_URL>' >> ~/.zshenv
    ```

    For bash:

    ```bash
    echo 'export KICKTIPP_EMAIL=<KICKTIPP_EMAIL>' >> ~/.bash_profile      
    echo 'export KICKTIPP_PASSWORD=<KICKTIPP_PASSWORD>' >> ~/.bash_profile  
    echo 'export KICKTIPP_NAME_OF_COMPETITION=<NAME_OF_COMPETITION>' >> ~/.bash_profile
    # ZAPIER_URL is optional
    echo 'export ZAPIER_URL=<ZAPIER_URL>' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```

    You may also source the `setup.sh`-script:

    ```bash
    source setup.sh
    ```

6. Execute the script

    ```bash
    python3 main.py local withZapier # with GUI and Zapier
    # or
    python3 main.py headless # without GUI and Zapier
    ```
